# Final Project: Food Insecurity in Georgia

This dashboard was created for my final project in Data 555. It explores how food insecurity is impacted by distance to supermarkets, lack of vehicle access, and racial demographics across 20 counties in Georgia using data from the USDA Food Access Research Atlas (2019).

## Data Source  
- USDA Food Access Research Atlas  
  [https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/)  
- Year: 2019  
- Sample size: 72,000 U.S. Census Tracts

## About the Data  
I selected the counties in this dashboard to reflect a mix of urban, suburban, and rural areas across Georgia. I intentionally included both predominantly Black and predominantly White counties to highlight racial and geographic disparities in food access. My goal is to show how race, location, and transportation all influence food insecurity.

## Dashboard Widgets/Features  
- Interactive map showing food insecurity rates by county

## Why It Matters/ Real World Impact
This dashboard shows how distance to grocery stores and lack of transportation affect food access in Georgia. It helps highlight which communities may need more support to reduce food insecurity.
