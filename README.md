# Final Project: Food Insecurity in Georgia

This dashboard was created for my final project in Data 555. It explores how food insecurity is impacted by distance to supermarkets, lack of vehicle access, and racial demographics across 20 counties in Georgia using data from the USDA Food Access Research Atlas (2019).

## Why It Matters
This dashboard shows how distance to grocery stores and lack of transportation affect food access in Georgia. It helps highlight which communities may need more support to reduce food insecurity.

## Dashboard Widgets/Features  
- Interactive map showing food insecurity rates by county  
- Scatter plot comparing supermarket distance vs. food insecurity  
- Table and dropdown to explore counties seperately 

## About the Data  
The counties in this dashboard were selected to reflect a diverse mix of urban, suburban, and rural regions across Georgia. I purposefully included both predominantly Black and predominantly White counties to highlight racial and geographic disparities in food access. This will help show how race, location, and transportation all influence food insecurity.
